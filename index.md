Section B08

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

So far, the most interesting topic covered is how fragile our power lines and power equipment around town. It doesn't take
much to cause a power outtage or to damage electrical equipment. That is one of the major reasons SDG&E is utilizing
machine learning to better predict/discover damaged equipment.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

One idea I have is to investigate all of the underground power boxes around town that do not have safety poles near them. The safety polls would be there to prevent cars from colliding into them. If collided with, there's a good chance that the car and anything touching it could become energized and possibly shock someone. Installing poles could prevent this. One way to utilize machine learning with this issue is to analyze google street view images to see which ones do not have poles and then further analyze the boxes that are most at risk for collisions.

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

This is honestly hard to say since we haven't gotten a hold of a total foundation for our quarter 1 project just yet. I would change that our group hasn't gotten together yet to brainstorm ideas. There are many good ideas that we float around each week and it seems like we can do them but we haven't really nailed one down just yet. I would like for us to have coordinated 

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

SDG&E has tons of data from customer data to equipment data. Right now, we are just using image data. But, we could possibly use regression of some sort using this other data to predict wild fires or equipment failures in the future.
